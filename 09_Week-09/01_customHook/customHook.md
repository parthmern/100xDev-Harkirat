## custom Hook 

### What are hooks ? 
- Hooks are a feature introduced in React 16.8 that allow you to use state and other React features without writing a class. They are functions that let you "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from function components.

- before 2015 or 2016 , there is nothing like states we need to create custom hooks for this so in past code base you can see this type of code
